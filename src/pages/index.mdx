# Darko Bozhinovski

A software developer with a focus on the JavaScript family of technologies
 
<span className="grey">I am a developer that likes to work on the more experimental side of things. Exploring new technologies and combining existing ones towards new uses is what I enjoy the most. I do not associate myself with particular languages but I do enjoy working with the JavaScript family of languages and platforms. </span>

    title="Virtask"
    description="Lead developer | 2015 - Present"
    skills={['JavaScript', 'TypeScript', 'React', 'Node.js', 'Electron', 'NLU/NLP']}
    link="https://anne4care.nl/"
  >

I built the first prototype and the following actual product for Virtask, 
called Anne. Anne is a virtual assistant, mostly focused on having a human 
touch to assisted living. In more concrete terms, Anne is a kiosk-mode 
desktop application, aimed at being a simplified desktop for people in 
assisted living or suffering from various medical conditions. 
My work (aside from leading the dev team), mostly revolves around NLU/NLP, 
making speech recognition systems behave and speak to the electron.js 
desktop application, building modules for the said electron.js application 
and some occasional server work with node.js. In 2019, we began migrating the 
application to TypeScript, and we went through a (successful) partial 
rewrite for the most important systems of the application.

I lead a team that was in charge of building a very innovative idea -
phishing as a service. As weird as it sounds, it is a piece of software 
used by one of the largest risk advisory companies in the world to automate 
risk assessments in large companies that are using their services. 
My work included both client and server-side JavaScript, 
reviewing my team's code and making architectural choices for the 
application.

Eterni.me had the very progressive idea of keeping one virtually immortal,
by way of having a user talk to a chatbot which learned about them, their lives,
habits, personality etc. In time, it was to become more like the user, so in
100 years time, someone would be able to get an idea of how were you as a person.
A digital legacy, of sorts. This was my first foray into NLP / NLU and some basic
AI. My day-to-day work was mostly around Node.js and JavaScript.

My team and I worked together on a web scraper, aimed mostly at 
crawling online markets in search of best deals / better prices for a 
given product. In a nutshell, a fresh take on a context-sensitive web crawler.
My work was mostly on the front-end, using JavaScript.

Together with my team, we were in charge of building critical pieces for an 
online video platform. My work in particular included building / working on 
a distributed video transcoding service (still in use to this day), a P2P 
content delivery network and a couple of Smart TV apps.

My work at re4m includes development of various tablet and smartphone 
applications using web technologies. These applications varied from 
simple promotional apps all the way to GPS route tracking and personal 
finance. Additionally, I worked on a couple of web pages, mostly doing 
front-end work.

I created and taught the JavaScript curriculum for people looking to change
careers and learn web development. My work was about creating lectures, 
homework and coding challenges for my students, with a focus on learning 
the basics of JavaScript with a few more "modern" concepts, related to React.

I started a local BeerJS - an international meetup for JavaScript
professionals and enthusiasts. So far, we've had 5 meetups, on various 
JavaScript related topics. I usually moderate, and I have given one presentation 
on how to build an offline, browser-based chatbot. I also maintain the 
site and the blog for the meetup.

This was one of my first attempts at educational work. I created a video course
aimed at JavaScript developer that aimed to get started with CoffeeScript. It
was an interesting experience, and it allowed me to learn both languages in more depth.
